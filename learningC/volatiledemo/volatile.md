volatile is a special type of modifier which informs the compiler that the value of the variable may be changed by external entities other than the program itself. This is nec- essary for certain programs compiled with optimizations â€“ if a variable were not defined volatile then the compiler may assume that certain operations involving the variable are safe to optimize away when in fact they aren't. `volatile is particularly relevant when work- ing with embedded systems (where a program may not have complete control of a variable) and multi-threaded applications`.
